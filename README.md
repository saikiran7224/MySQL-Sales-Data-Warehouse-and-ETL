# MySQL-Sales-Data-Warehouse-and-ETL
This project involves building an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to create a Sales Data Warehouse using MySQL, Python, and Pandas. It extracts raw sales data from CSV files, cleans and transforms it for consistency and quality, and loads the processed data into MySQL to support analytical reporting and business insights.
